# AutomatePortfolio

This is the new directory that was split away from EC381.  It will contain the work that will develope the automated portfolio.  It used to have the development branch and this may be revived.  POrtfolio directory to be eventually deleted from EC381 when I am sure that this all works fine. 

###To make it work
1. Use the wrapper.R function to load the other functions.
2. The test.R function will run a series of trades.  There are some elements in PortfolioValue.R that will calculate returns.  This needs to be more generally developed.  How will this be stored?
